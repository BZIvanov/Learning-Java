# Static initializer

The `static` block is a `static initializer` that runs once when the class is loaded into memory. It's commonly used to initialize static variables or perform setup operations that need to be done once.

## Explanation:

- The **static block runs once** when the class is loaded into memory.
- It initializes the `value` variable.
- The **main method** starts executing afterward.
- When an instance of **StaticBlockExample** is created, the constructor runs.
