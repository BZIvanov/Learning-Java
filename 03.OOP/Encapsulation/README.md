# Encapsulation

Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or object.

Encapsulation is the process of bundling the data (fields) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is usually achieved through access modifiers (like `private`, `protected`, or `public`) and by providing controlled access through methods such as getters and setters. This promotes data security, modularity, and ease of maintenance.
