# Polymorphism

Ability of a class to take on multiple forms.

## Why use Polymorphism?

- **Flexibility:** Write generic code that works for multiple types (e.g., parent references for child objects).
- **Extensibility:** Add new behavior easily by overriding methods in subclasses.
- **Cleaner Code:** Reduce redundant code with shared interfaces or parent classes.
