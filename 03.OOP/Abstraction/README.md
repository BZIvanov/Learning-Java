# Abstraction

Simplification of complex systems by focusing on the essential features and hiding away the unnecessary details.

Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by highlighting the essential features relevant to a specific context and hiding unnecessary implementation details. In Java, abstraction is implemented using abstract classes and interfaces. It helps in designing flexible and reusable code by focusing on "what" an object does rather than "how" it achieves it.
